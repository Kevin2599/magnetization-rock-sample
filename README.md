####Abstract

Over the last decades, scanning magnetic microscopy techniques have 
been increasingly used in paleomagnetism and rock magnetism. 
Different from standard paleomagnetic magnetometers, scanning 
magnetic microscopes produce high-resolution maps of the vertical 
component of the magnetic induction field (flux density) 
on a plane located over the sample. 
These high-resolution magnetic maps can be used for estimating the 
magnetization distribution within a rock sample by inversion.
Previous studies have estimated the magnetization distribution 
within rock samples by inverting the magnetic data measured on a 
single plane above the sample. Here we present a new spatial domain
method for inverting the magnetic induction measured on four 
planes around the sample in order to retrieve its internal 
magnetization distribution. We have presumed that the internal 
magnetization distribution of the sample varies along one of
its axes. Our method approximates the sample geometry
by an interpretation model composed of a one-dimensional 
array of juxtaposed rectangular prisms with uniform magnetization. 
The Cartesian components of the magnetization vector 
within each rectangular prism 
are the parameters to be estimated by solving a linear inverse problem. 
Our method automatically deals with the averaging of 
the measured magnetic data due to the finite size of the magnetic sensor,
preventing the application of a deconvolution before the inversion.
Tests with synthetic data show the performance of our method in 
retrieving complex magnetization distributions even in 
the presence of magnetization heterogeneities. 
Moreover, they show the advantage of inverting the magnetic data on
four planes around the sample adn how this new acquisition scheme
improves the estimated magnetization distribution within the rock
sample.
We have also applied our method to invert experimentally measured 
magnetic data produced by a highly-magnetized synthetic sample 
that was manufactured in the laboratory.
The results show that, even in the presence of apparent position
noise, our method was able to retrieve the magnetization distribution
consistent with the isothermal remanent magnetization
induced in the sample.
